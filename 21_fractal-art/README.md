Printing the solution
=====================

I got sloppy with this problem, so bear with me. If you pass a number as the first argument to the program, it will print the image after that many iterations.

Example: `cargo run --release -- 5 < input.txt`

With no arguments (or an invalid first argument), the program will just run normally.
